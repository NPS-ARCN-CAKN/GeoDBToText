# GeoDBToText
One goal of long term ecosystem monitoring programs is to preserve data in non-proprietary human and machine readable ASCII text file formats. Additionally, the U.S. government requires non-sensitive data to be publicly available in human and machine readable formats (see https://project-open-data.cio.gov/).

ESRI geodatabases are highly functional for day to day use but are highly likely to be unsupported/unreadable decades in the future and do not meet open data requirements. The GeoDBToText tool prevents data loss by exporting each feature class in an ESRI personal geodatabase (.mdb) to human and machine text (pipe separated values/WKT, ESRI JSON) file formats. Should the original geodatabase be unusable the text files generated by this tool should still be recoverable. The National Park Service Arctic and Central Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Networks archive proprietary geospatial datasets in tandem with human and machine readable text file formats.
